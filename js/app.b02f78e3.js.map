Unsere sieben Weißweinsorten werden mit viel Liebe und Herzblut vorwiegend per Hand bearbeitet. Ein gesunder Boden, der Erhalt typischer Weinbergkräuter und Rücksicht auf alles was kräucht und fleucht schaffen für unsere Reben ein lebendiges Umfeld. In solch einem kleinen Weinberg gelingt die Punktlandung der Lese unserer Trauben bei einem optimalen Verhältnis von Zucker und Säure . Im neu gebauten Weinkeller wird der Wein in Edelstahltanks ausgebaut und bekommt die notwendige Ruhe und Zeit zu reifen. Das Resultat sind ehrliche Weine mit Seele, mit dem Charakter der Radebeuler Niederlößnitz und des Jahres, in dem er herangereift ist. In unserer Straußwirtschaft mitten im Weinberg können Sie unsere Weine genießen. Kleine köstliche Speisen werden dazu gereicht. Eine naturnahe und umweltschonende Bewirtschaftung ist für mich selbstverständlich.

Die operative Tätigkeit des „neuen” Rinderzuchtverbandes begann mit 2. Juli 2018. Zurzeit betreut der Südtiroler Rinderzuchtverband 5.000 Mitglieder. Die Ziele des Südtiroler Rinderzuchtverbandes sind die Förderung der Viehwirtschaft sowie die Erhaltung der traditionellen Berglandwirtschaft. Durch die stetige Verbesserung des Zuchtviehbestandes und einer gesicherten Vermarktung wird den Bauern ein erfolgreiches und zukunftsorientiertes Wirtschaften ermöglicht.\",\r\n    //   tags: [\"Rind\", \"Beef\", \"Steak\", \"Kalb\"],\r\n    //   images: [\r\n    //     {\r\n    //       id: 0,\r\n    //       src:\r\n    //         \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1567879656049-f2265f23d8f8?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1099&q=80\",\r\n    //       title: \"Bild 1\"\r\n    //     },\r\n    //     {\r\n    //       id: 1,\r\n    //       src:\r\n    //         \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551298457-c72eced6d0ad?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1100&q=80\",\r\n    //       title: \"Bild 2\"\r\n    //     },\r\n    //     {\r\n    //       id: 2,\r\n    //       src:\r\n    //         \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1575555847433-1d79da697ecc?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1051&q=80\",\r\n    //       title: \"Bild 3\"\r\n    //     },\r\n    //     {\r\n    //       id: 3,\r\n    //       src:\r\n    //         \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558030006-450675393462?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1189&q=80\",\r\n    //       title: \"Bild 4\"\r\n    //     }\r\n    //   ],\r\n    //   address: {\r\n    //     postcode: \"85609\",\r\n    //     city: \"Aschheim\",\r\n    //     addressLine1: \"Merowingerstraße 17\",\r\n    //     country: \"Germany\"\r\n    //   },\r\n    //   mapIcon: \"cow\"\r\n    // },\r\n    // {\r\n    //   userEmail: \"TestEmail4@web.de\",\r\n    //   title: \"Fisher BestFish\",\r\n    //   subtitle: \"\",\r\n    //   description:\r\n    //     \"Ganz einfach: Man geht, wie Josef Ertl, in seiner Freizeit morgens um 5 Uhr am Olchinger See zum Angeln und fängt wochenlang nichts! Daraus entstand der Gedanke: Dann zieh ich mir halt die Fische selber!“…. gesagt-getan! Dort wo einst nur Felder und Wiesen waren, setzten Rosa und Josef Ertl im Jahre 1973 den ersten Spatenstich für ihre eigenen Fischteiche. Seitdem werden die Leckerbissen selbst gezüchtet und Josef Ertl hat es geschafft, sein liebstes Hobby zum Beruf zu machen. Zuerst standen die Aufzucht und der Verkauf von Forellen im Vordergrund. Inzwischen bieten wir eine Vielfalt an erlesenen Spezialitäten aus unserem Wasser in unserem Verkaufsladen an, der sich direkt neben der Teichanlage befindet. Das ganze Jahr erhalten Sie fangfrische Regenbogenforellen, Lachsforellen, Saiblinge und neu im Programm auch die Bachforelle. Von Anfang Oktober bis etwa März schwimmen noch Karpfen aus der Oberpfalz, Wels/Waller und Störe in unseren Gewässern. Täglich fangfrisch, ofenfrisch geräuchert, im Ganzen oder als Filet, je nach Kundenwunsch werden die Fische von uns in Handarbeit verarbeitet und veredelt.\",\r\n    //   tags: [\"Fish\", \"Fisher\",
